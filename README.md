# Cider Falls

This project has your team building an application for the Cider Falls National Park that will track park area, park activities, and park guests.

## Professional Collaboration

In this project, you are expected to start building your professional collaboration skills by writing issue tickets and having professional pull requests. During your wireframing and algorithmic thinking design process, you are going to be creating tickets for your efforts.

Here's the link to the [Github Workflow Guides](https://nashville-software-school.github.io/github-workflow/) that everyone must use during this project.

You will need to clone this repository, create a project board, and create issue tickets once you have used your analytical and algorithmic thinking to define tasks. Make sure you review all articles and videos that we provide for you in the guides. You are expected to produce high quality documentation.

### User Stories

**As** a user I want to see what services the areas of the park offer, so I know which area to visit to do what I want, and  
**when** I click on the area,  
**then** it lists the associated activities 

**As** a user I what guests are at in a given area. So I would know how many guests are there and if its too crowded. and  
**when** i click on the the area  
**then** it will show me how many guests are there.
